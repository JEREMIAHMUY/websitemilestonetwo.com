            <p>
              In the United Kingdom, one of the most reputable mental health
              centres is the Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust.
              This is one of the largest mental health and disability trusts in
              England, serving a population of approximately 1.7 million, with a
              staff of more than 7,000. The Trust boasts an Outstanding CQC
              rating. Their flagship programme “Respond” provides innovative
              training for professionals from sectors such as policing, social
              care and healthcare to help them understand the underlying issues
              in mental health care and work together collaboratively. Their
              pilot programme “Street Triage” pairs up a mental health nurse
              with dedicated police officers to care for mental health patients.
              This program has more than halved the number of police detentions
              under the Mental Health Act. The strategy at the heart of this
              initiative is to promote prevention, early intervention, and
              resilience and make mental health the cornerstone of all
              healthcare interventions.

            disorders.

                No one would ever say that someone with a broken arm or a broken
                leg is less than a whole person, but people say that or imply
                that all the time about people with mental illness.

                Mental illness… occurs when our mental health is compromised or
                neglected for so long that it affects our ability to function in
                our everyday life.

          <p>
            Soon after its establishment the main task was teaching behavioural
            sciences and psychiatry to the undergraduate medical students. The
            syllabuses for these courses are regularly reviewed to make sure
            that the graduates are well equipped to handle the common mental
            health problems in the community.
